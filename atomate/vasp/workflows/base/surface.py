    """
        Workflow manager with a set of common database and calculation specs for
            all workflows. The workflow will use VASP to ultimately calculate the
            results needed to derive the surface energy and work function. Other
            properties such as the Wulff shape, weighted surface energy and weighted
            work functions can then be derived from these basic properties.

        The user has the option of started their calculations from the conventional
            unit cell which will calculate all oriented unit cells, terminations,
            and reconstructions of slabs, or from an oriented unit cell which will
            calculate all possible terminations for a specific facet or from a
            single slab structure which will just calculate the given slab. The
            use of the oriented unit cell calculations provides us with well
            converged surface quantities.
