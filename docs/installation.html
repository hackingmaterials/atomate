<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This guide will get you up and running in an environment for running high-throughput workflows with atomate. atomate is built on pymatgen, custodian, and FireWorks libraries to run materials science workflows. Briefly:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://pymatgen.org">pymatgen</a> is used to create input files and analyze the output of materials science codes</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://materialsproject.github.io/custodian/">custodian</a> runs your simulation code (e.g., VASP) and performs error checking/handling and checkpointing</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://materialsproject.github.io/fireworks/">FireWorks</a> is used to design, manage and execute workflows.</li>
</ul>
<p>Details about how atomate is designed can be found in the <a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2017.07.030">atomate paper</a> and an overview of how these different pieces interact are in a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.slideshare.net/anubhavster/software-tools-for-calculating-materials-properties-in-highthroughput-pymatgen-atomate-fireworks">Slideshare presentation</a>. Running and writing your own workflows are covered in later tutorials. For now, these topics will be covered in enough depth to get you set up and to help you know where to troubleshoot if you are having problems.</p>
<p>It is assumed that you are comfortable with basic Linux shell commands and navigation. If not, <a class="reference external" href="https://linuxjourney.com/lesson/the-shell">Linux Journey</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_learning_the_shell.php">Linux Command</a> breifly cover enough to get you started. It will also be helpful if you are familiar with Python, but it is not strictly required for installation.</p>
<p>Note that this installation tutorial is VASP-centric since almost all functionality currently in atomate pertains to VASP.</p>

<div class="section" id="prerequisites">
<span id="id1"></span><h2>Prerequisites<a class="headerlink" href="#prerequisites" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Before you install, you need to make sure that your “worker” computer (where the simulations will be run, often a computing cluster) that will execute workflows can (i) run the base simulation packages (e.g., VASP, LAMMPs, FEFF, etc) and (ii) connect to a MongoDB database. For (i), make sure you have the appropriate licenses and compilation to run the simulation packages that are needed. For (ii), make sure your computing center doesn’t have firewalls that prevent database access. Typically, academic computing clusters as well as systems with a MOM-node style architecture (e.g., NERSC) are OK. High-security government supercomputing centers often require custom treatment and modified execution patterns - some further details are provided later in this installation guide.</p>
<div class="section" id="vasp">
<h3>VASP<a class="headerlink" href="#vasp" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To get access to VASP on supercomputing resources typically requires that you are added to a user group on the system you work on after your license is verified. Ensure that you have access to the VASP executable and that it is functional before starting this tutorial.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mongodb">
<h3>MongoDB<a class="headerlink" href="#mongodb" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/">MongoDB</a> is a NoSQL database that stores each database entry as a document, which is represented in the JSON format (the formatting is similar to a dictionary in Python). Atomate uses MongoDB to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>store the workflows that you want to run as well as their state details (through FireWorks - required)</li>
<li>to parse output files and create database of calculation results (strongly recommended and assumed by most default settings of workflows, but technically optional)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that there are various tools to query this information later, ranging from highly useful tools that work on all MongoDB databases (e.g., MongoDB command line, MongoDB GUI programs) as well as analysis tools built into pymatgen-db, FireWorks, and atomate that are generally more specific to the information generated by these codebases.</p>
<p>MongoDB must be running and available to accept connections whenever you are running workflows. Thus, it is strongly recommended that you have a server to run MongoDB or (simpler) use a hosting service. Your options are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>use a commercial service to host your MongoDB instance. These are typically the easiest to use and offer high quality service but require payment for larger databases. <a class="reference external" href="https://mlab.com">mLab</a> offers free 500 MB databases with payment required for larger databases or support/backup; another similar option is <a class="reference external" href="https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas">MongoDB Atlas</a>. The free tiers of these commercial services are certainly enough to get started for small to medium size projects.</li>
<li>contact your supercomputing center to see if they offer MongoDB hosting (e.g., NERSC has this, Google “request NERSC MongoDB database”)</li>
<li>self-host a MongoDB server</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are just starting, we suggest the first (with a free plan) or second option (if available to you). The third option will require you to open up network settings to accept outside connections properly which can sometimes be tricky.</p>
<p>Next, create a new database and set up two new username/password combinations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>an admin user</li>
<li>a read-only user</li>
</ul>
<p>You might choose to have <em>two</em> separate databases - one for the workflows and another for the results. We suggest that new users keep both sets of results in a single database and only consider using two databases if they run into specific problems.</p>
<p>Keep a record of your credentials - we will configure FireWorks to connect to them in a later step. Also make sure you note down the hostname and port for the MongoDB instance.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<blockquote>
<div>The computers that perform the calculations must have access to your MongoDB server. Some computing resources have firewalls blocking connections. Although this is not a problem for most computing centers that allow such connections (particularly from MOM-style nodes, e.g. at NERSC, SDSC, etc.), but some of the more security-sensitive centers (e.g., LLNL, PNNL) will run into issues. If you run into connection issues later in this tutorial, some options are:</div></blockquote>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>contact your computing center to review their security policy to allow connections from your MongoDB server (best resolution)</li>
<li>set up an ssh tunnel to forward connections from allowed machines (the tunnel must be kept alive at all times you are running workflows)</li>
<li>use <a class="reference external" href="https://materialsproject.github.io/fireworks/offline_tutorial.html">FireWorks offline mode</a>, which is a workable solution but makes the system more difficult to use and limits some features of FireWorks.</li>

<div class="section" id="create-a-directory-scaffold-for-atomate">
<span id="id3"></span><h2>Create a directory scaffold for atomate<a class="headerlink" href="#create-a-directory-scaffold-for-atomate" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Installing atomate includes installation of codes, configuration files, and various binaries and libraries. Thus, it is useful to create a directory structure that organizes all these items.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Log in to the compute cluster and make sure the Python module you want to use is loaded. We highly recommend to make sure Python is loaded upon login, e.g. through an rc file (e.g. <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.bashrc</span></code> at most centers or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.bashrc.ext</span></code> at NERSC)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Create a directory in a spot on disk that has relatively fast access from compute nodes <em>and</em> that is only accessible by yourself or your collaborators. Your environment and configuration files will go here, including database credentials. We will call this place <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;&lt;INSTALL_DIR&gt;&gt;</span></code>. A good name might simply be <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">atomate</span></code>, but you could also use a project-specific name (e.g., <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">atomate-solar</span></code>).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Now you should scaffold the rest of your <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;&lt;INSTALL_DIR&gt;&gt;</span></code> for the things we are going to do next. Create a directories named <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">logs</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">config</span></code> so your directory structure looks like:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>atomate
├── config
└── logs
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ol>

<div class="section" id="create-a-python-virtual-environment">
<span id="id4"></span><h2>Create a Python virtual environment<a class="headerlink" href="#create-a-python-virtual-environment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We highly recommended that you organize your installation of the atomate and the other Python codes using a virtual environment (e.g. <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">virtualenv</span></code> or similar tool such as anaconda).
Ultimately, whether you want to use a virtual environment is optional and you don’t have to use one if you know what you are doing.
Virtual environments allow you to keep an installation of Python and all of the installed packages separate from the installation on the system.
Some of the main benefits are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Different Python projects that have conflicting packages can coexist on the same machine.</li>
<li>Different versions of Python can exist on the same machine and be managed more easily (e.g. Python 2 and Python 3).</li>
<li>You have full rights and control over the environment. If it breaks, you can just delete the folder containing the environment and recreate it. On computing resources, this solves permissions issues with installing and modifying packages.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The easiest way to get a Python virtual environment is to use the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">virtualenv</span></code> tool.
Most Python distributions come with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">virtualenv</span></code>, but some clusters (e.g., NERSC) have moved towards using <a class="reference external" href="https://www.continuum.io">Anaconda</a>, which is a popular distribution of Python designed for scientific computing that can serve the same purpose.
If the compute resource you want to access is using Anaconda, you will follow the same general steps, but create your environment with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">conda</span> <span class="pre">create</span></code>.
See the <a class="reference external" href="https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html">documentation for the conda command line tool here</a> as well as a <a class="reference external" href="https://conda.io/docs/commands.html#conda-vs-pip-vs-virtualenv-commands">conversion between virtualenv and conda commands</a>.
To set up your virtual environment:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Go to your install directory (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;&lt;INSTALL_DIR&gt;&gt;</span></code>) and create a virtual environment there. A good name might be <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">atomate_env</span></code>. The default command to create the environment would be <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">virtualenv</span> <span class="pre">atomate_env</span></code>, which creates a folder <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">atomate_env</span></code> in the directory you are in.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">You can <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ls</span></code> this directory and see that you have the following structure:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>atomate
├──atomate_env/
   ├── bin
   ├── include
   ├── lib
   ├── lib64
   └── pip-selfcheck.json
├── config
└── logs
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If you look in the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bin</span></code> directory, you will see several programs, such as activate, pip, and Python itself. <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lib</span></code> will be where all of your installed packages will be kept, etc. Again, if anything goes wrong in installing Python codes, you can just delete the virtual environment directory (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">atomate_env</span></code>) and start again.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Activate your environment by running <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">source</span> <span class="pre">&lt;&lt;INSTALL_DIR&gt;&gt;/atomate_env/bin/activate</span></code>. This makes it so when you use the command <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span></code>, the version of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span></code> that you use will be the one in the  <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bin</span></code> directory rather than the system-wide Python. You can read the activation script if you are interested. It’s just does a little magic to adjust your path to point towards the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bin</span></code> and other directories you created.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Consider adding <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">source</span> <span class="pre">&lt;&lt;INSTALL_DIR&gt;&gt;/atomate_env/bin/activate</span></code> to your .rc  or .bash_profile file so that it is run whenever you log in. Otherwise, note that you must call this command after every log in before you can do work on your atomate project.</p>
</li>

<div class="section" id="install-python-packages">
<span id="id5"></span><h2>Install Python packages<a class="headerlink" href="#install-python-packages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You have successfully set up an environment in which to install atomate!
Next, we will download and install all of the atomate-related Python packages.</p>
<p>You can install these packages automatically or in “development mode”. Development mode installation makes it easier to view and modify the source code to your needs, but requires a few more steps to set up and maintain.</p>
<p>To install packages automatically, the main tool we will use is pip (unless you have an Anaconda distribution where you’d again use <a class="reference external" href="https://conda.io/docs/using/pkgs.html">conda</a>). To install the packages run:</p>

<p>In FireWorks’ distributed <a class="reference external" href="https://materialsproject.github.io/fireworks/index.html#centralized-server-and-worker-model">server-worker model</a>, each computing resource where you run jobs is a FireWorker (Worker). Each worker (like NERSC or SDSC or your local cluster) needs some configuration:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">name</span></code> to help record-keeping of what calculation ran where</li>
<li>Two parameters (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">category</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">query</span></code>) that can be used to control which calculations are executed on this Worker. Our default settings will just allow all calculations to be run.</li>
<li>An <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">env</span></code> that controls the environment and settings unique to the cluster, such as the path to VASP executable or location of a scratch directory which is dependent on your computing system</li>
</ul>
<p>If this is the only cluster you plan on using just one Worker for all of your calculations a minimal setup for the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">my_fworker.yaml</span></code> file is</p>

<p>Where the &lt;&lt;WORKER_NAME&gt;&gt; is arbitrary and is useful for keeping track of which Worker is running your jobs (an example might be <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Edison</span></code> if you are running on NERSC’s Edison resource). <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">db_file</span></code> points to the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">db.json</span></code> file that you just configured and contains credentials to connect to the calculation output database. The &lt;&lt;VASP_CMD&gt;&gt; is the command that you would use to run VASP with parallelization (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">srun</span> <span class="pre">-n</span> <span class="pre">16</span> <span class="pre">vasp</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ibrun</span> <span class="pre">-n</span> <span class="pre">16</span> <span class="pre">vasp</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mpirun</span> <span class="pre">-n</span> <span class="pre">16</span> <span class="pre">vasp</span></code>, …). If you don’t know which of these to use or which VASP executable is correct, check the documentation for the computing resource you are running on or try to find them interactively by checking the output of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">which</span> <span class="pre">srun</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">which</span> <span class="pre">vasp_std</span></code>, etc. Optionally, you can set the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">scratch_dir</span></code> to something other than null if there is a particular location where you have fast disk access. This key sets the “root” scratch dir; a temporary directory will be created in this root directory for each calculation. Scratch directories are only temporarily while the calculation is executing.</p>
<p>If you later want to set up multiple Workers on the same or different machines, you can find information about controlling which Worker can run which job by using the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">name</span></code> field above, or the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">category</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">query</span></code> fields that we did not define. For more information on configuring multiple Workers, see the <a class="reference external" href="https://materialsproject.github.io/fireworks/controlworker.html?highlight=category">FireWorks documentation for controlling Workers</a>. Such features allow you to use different settings (e.g., different VASP command such as different parallelization amount) for different types of calculations on the same machine or control what jobs are run on various computing centers.</p>

<p>The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">db.json</span></code> file contained the information to connect to MongoDB for the calculation <em>output</em> database. We must also configure the database for storing and managing workflows within FireWorks using <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">my_launchpad.yaml</span></code> as in FireWorks’ <a class="reference external" href="https://materialsproject.github.io/fireworks/index.html#centralized-server-and-worker-model">server-worker model</a>. Technically, these can be different databases but we’ll configure them as the same database.</p>
<p>The LaunchPad is where all of the FireWorks and Workflows are stored. Each Worker can query this database for the status of Fireworks and pull down Fireworks to reserve them in the queue and run them. A <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">my_launchpad.yaml</span></code> file with fairly verbose logging (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">strm_lvl:</span> <span class="pre">INFO</span></code>) is below:</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;&lt;HOSTNAME&gt;&gt;</span></code> - the host of your MongoDB db server</li>

Delete these lines if you do not have password protection in your DB (although you should).</li>
</ul>
<p>You can optionally set <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">logdir</span></code> to your <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;&lt;INSTALL_DIR&gt;&gt;/logs</span></code> directory, although you shouldn’t need them.

<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you prefer to use the same database for FireWorks and calculation outputs, these values will largely be duplicated with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">db.json</span></code> (this is what our tutorial is assuming).

<h3>my_qadapter.yaml<a class="headerlink" href="#my-qadapter-yaml" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To run your VASP jobs at scale across one or more nodes, you usually submit your jobs through a queue system on the computing resources.
FireWorks handles communicating with some of the common queue systems automatically.
As usual, only the basic configuration options will be discussed.
If you will use atomate as in this tutorial, this basic configuration is sufficient.</p>
<p>If you do change anything, one key aspect would be to change the rocket launcher command from <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rapidfire</span></code> to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">singleshot</span></code>, which will let you launch in reservation mode.
Using the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">qlaunch</span></code> with the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-r</span></code> flag (reservation mode launching) means there is a 1:1 mapping of queue submission and VASP calculation.
This mode is also bit more complex than normal launching.
It may be worth going through the FireWorks documentation to understand the difference between these modes and making an informed choice about which mode to use.</p>

<p>To make sure that everything is set up correctly and in place, we’ll finally run a simple (but real) test workflow. Two methods to create workflows are (i) using atomate’s command line utility <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">atwf</span></code> or (ii) by creating workflows in Python. For the most part, we recommend using method (ii), the Python interface, since it is more powerful and also simple to use. However, in order to get started without any programming, we’ll stick to method (i), the command line, using <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">atwf</span></code> to construct a workflow. Note that we’ll discuss the Python interface more in the <a class="reference internal" href="running_workflows.html#running-workflows-tutorial"><span class="std std-ref">Running Workflows Tutorial</span></a> and provide details on writing custom workflows in the <a class="reference internal" href="creating_workflows.html#creating-workflows"><span class="std std-ref">Creating Workflows</span></a>.</p>
<p>Ideally you set up a Materials Project API key in the <a class="reference internal" href="#configure-pymatgen">Configure pymatgen</a> section, otherwise you will need to provide a POSCAR for the structure you want to run. In addition, there are two different methods to use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">atwf</span></code> - one using a library of preset functions for constructing workflows and another with a library of files for constructing workflows.</p>
<p>This particular workflow will only run a single calculation that optimizes a crystal structure (not very exciting). In the subsequent tutorials, we’ll run more complex workflows.</p>
<div class="section" id="add-a-workflow">
<h3>Add a workflow<a class="headerlink" href="#add-a-workflow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Below are 4 different options for adding a workflow to the database. You only need to execute one of the below commands; note that it doesn’t matter at this point whether you are loading the workflow from a file or from a Python function.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Option 1 (you set up a Materials Project API key, and want to load the workflow using a file): <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">atwf</span> <span class="pre">add</span> <span class="pre">-l</span> <span class="pre">vasp</span> <span class="pre">-s</span> <span class="pre">optimize_only.yaml</span> <span class="pre">-m</span> <span class="pre">mp-149</span> <span class="pre">-c</span> <span class="pre">'{&quot;vasp_cmd&quot;:</span> <span class="pre">&quot;&gt;&gt;vasp_cmd&lt;&lt;&quot;,</span> <span class="pre">&quot;db_file&quot;:</span> <span class="pre">&quot;&gt;&gt;db_file&lt;&lt;&quot;}'</span></code></li>

<li>Option 3 (you will load the structure from a POSCAR file, and want to load the workflow using a file): <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">atwf</span> <span class="pre">add</span> <span class="pre">-l</span> <span class="pre">vasp</span> <span class="pre">-s</span> <span class="pre">optimize_only.yaml</span> <span class="pre">POSCAR</span> <span class="pre">-c</span> <span class="pre">'{&quot;vasp_cmd&quot;:</span> <span class="pre">&quot;&gt;&gt;vasp_cmd&lt;&lt;&quot;,</span> <span class="pre">&quot;db_file&quot;:</span> <span class="pre">&quot;&gt;&gt;db_file&lt;&lt;&quot;}'</span></code></li>

</ul>
<p>All of these function specify (i) a type of workflow and (ii) the structure to feed into that workflow.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-l</span> <span class="pre">vasp</span></code> option states to use the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">vasp</span></code> library of workflows.</li>
<li>The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-s</span> <span class="pre">optimize_only.yaml</span></code> sets the specification of the workflow using the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">optimize_only.yaml</span></code> file in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/hackingmaterials/atomate/blob/master/atomate/vasp/workflows/base/library/">this directory</a>. Alternatively, the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-p</span> <span class="pre">wf_structure_optimization</span></code> sets the workflow specification using the preset Python function located in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/hackingmaterials/atomate/blob/master/atomate/vasp/workflows/presets/core.py">this module</a>. For now, it’s probably best not to worry about the distinction but to know that both libraries of workflows are available to you.</li>
<li>The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-c</span></code> option is used in file-based workflows to make sure that one uses the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">vasp_cmd</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">db_file</span></code> that are specified in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">my_fworker.yaml</span></code> that you specified earlier. In the preset workflows, it is the default behavior to take these parameters from the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">my_fworker.yaml</span></code> so this option is not needed.</li>

As simple modifications to the above command, you can also try <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lpad</span> <span class="pre">get_wflows</span> <span class="pre">-d</span> <span class="pre">more</span></code> (or if you are very curious, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lpad</span> <span class="pre">get_wflows</span> <span class="pre">-d</span> <span class="pre">all</span></code>). You can use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lpad</span> <span class="pre">get_wflows</span> <span class="pre">-h</span></code> to see a list of all available modifications and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lpad</span> <span class="pre">-h</span></code> to see all possible commands.</p>
<p>If this works, congrats! You’ve added a workflow (in this case, just a single calculation) to the FireWorks database.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="submit-the-workflow">
<h3>Submit the workflow<a class="headerlink" href="#submit-the-workflow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To launch this FireWork through queue, go to the directory where you would like your calculations to run (e.g. your scratch or work directories) and run the command</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>qlaunch rapidfire -m <span class="m">1</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>There are lots of things to note here:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-m</span> <span class="pre">1</span></code> means to keep a maximum of 1 job in the queue to prevent submitting too many jobs. As with all FireWorks commands, you can get more options using <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">qlaunch</span> <span class="pre">rapidfire</span> <span class="pre">-h</span></code> or simply <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">qlaunch</span> <span class="pre">-h</span></code>.</li>
<li>The qlaunch mode specified above is the simplest and most general way to get started. It will end up creating a somewhat nested directory structure, but this will make more sense when there are many calculations to run.</li>
<li>One other option for qlaunch is “reservation mode”, i.e., <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">qlaunch</span> <span class="pre">-r</span> <span class="pre">rapidfire</span></code>. There are many nice things about this mode - you’ll get pretty queue job names that represent your calculated composition and task type (these are really nice to see specifically which calculations are queued) and you’ll have more options for tailoring specific queue parameters to specific jobs. In addition, reservation mode will automatically stop submitting jobs to the queue depending on how many jobs you have in the database so you don’t need to use the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-m</span> <span class="pre">1</span></code> parameter (this is usually desirable and nice, although in some cases it’s better to submit to the queue first and add jobs to the database later which reservation mode doesn’t support). However, reservation mode does add its own complications and we do not recommend starting with it (in many if not most cases, it’s not worth switching at all). If you are interested by this option, consult the FireWorks documentation for more details.</li>
<li>If you want to run directly on your computing platform rather than through a queue, use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rlaunch</span> <span class="pre">rapidfire</span></code> instead of the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">qlaunch</span></code> command (go through the FireWorks documentation to understand the details).</li>
</ul>
<p>If all went well, you can check that the FireWork is in the queue by using the commands for your queue system (e.g. <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">squeue</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">qstat</span></code>). When the job finally starts running, you will see the state of the workflow as running using the command <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lpad</span> <span class="pre">get_wflows</span> <span class="pre">-d</span> <span class="pre">more</span></code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="analyzing-the-results">
<h3>Analyzing the results<a class="headerlink" href="#analyzing-the-results" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Once this FireWorks is launched and is completed, you can use pymatgen-db to check that it was entered into your results database by running</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>mgdb query -c <span class="s">&lt;&lt;INSTALL_DI</span>R&gt;&gt;/config/db.json --props task_id formula_pretty output.energy_per_atom
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This time, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;&lt;INSTALL_DIR&gt;&gt;</span></code> can be relative. You should have seen the energy per atom you calculated for Si.</p>
<p>Note that the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mgdb</span></code> tools is only one way to see the results. You can connect to your MongoDB and explore the results using any MongoDB analysis tool. In later tools, we’ll also demonstrate how various Python classes in atomate also help in retrieving and analyzing data. For now, the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mgdb</span></code> command is a simple way to get basic properties.</p>
<p>You can also check that the workflow is marked as completed in your FireWorks database:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>lpad get_wflows -d more
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>which will show the state of the workflow as COMPLETED.</p>
