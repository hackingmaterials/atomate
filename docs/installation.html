<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This guide will get you up and running in an environment for running high-throughput workflows with atomate. atomate is built on pymatgen, custodian, and FireWorks libraries to run materials science workflows. Briefly:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://pymatgen.org">pymatgen</a> is used for creating input and analyzing output of materials science codes</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://materialsproject.github.io/custodian/">custodian</a> runs VASP and performs error checking/handling and checkpointing</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://materialsproject.github.io/fireworks/">FireWorks</a> enables designing, managing and executing workflows.</li>
</ul>
<p>Details about how atomate is designed, how these different pieces interact, and how to run and write your own workflows will be covered in later tutorials as well as an academic publication on atomate. For now, these topics will be covered here in enough depth to get you set up and to help you know where to troubleshoot if you are having problems.</p>
<p>It is assumed that you are comfortable with basic Linux shell commands and navigation. If not, <a class="reference external" href="https://linuxjourney.com/lesson/the-shell">Linux Journey</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_learning_the_shell.php">Linux Command</a> breifly cover enough to get you started. It will also be helpful if you are familiar with Python, but it is not strictly required for installation.</p>

<h2>Automated installer<a class="headerlink" href="#automated-installer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.phases.psu.edu">Phases Research Lab at Penn State</a> has developed an <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/PhasesResearchLab/install-atomate">automated installer</a> to install atomate with minimal user interaction. The installer simply scripts all of the actions given in this installation guide after the user configures their database (see the <a class="reference internal" href="#configure-fireworks">Configure FireWorks</a> section). There are a select few preset systems that are handled automatically (include TACC’s Stampede, NERSC’s Edison and Cori) and otherwise all of the relevant settings can be tweaked in one script and installed. For instructions on the use of the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/PhasesResearchLab/install-atomate">automated installer</a>, see the README. <strong>Disclaimer</strong>: this installer comes with no guarantees or warranty and the authors are not responsible for any problems caused (see the LICENSE). If you run into problems caused by the installer, please open an issue on GitHub.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="prerequisites">
<span id="id2"></span><h2>Prerequisites<a class="headerlink" href="#prerequisites" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Before you install, you need to make sure that your “worker” computer (where the simulations will be run, often a computing cluster) that will execute workflows can (i) run the base simulation packages (e.g., VASP, LAMMPs, FEFF, etc) and (ii) connect to a MongoDB database. For (i), make sure you have the appropriate licenses and compilation to run the simulation packages that are needed. For (ii), make sure your computing center doesn’t have firewalls that prevent database access. Typically, academic computing clusters as well as systems with a MOM-node style architecture (e.g., NERSC) are OK. High-security government supercomputing centers often require custom treatment and modified execution patterns - some further details are provided later in this installation guide.</p>
<div class="section" id="vasp">
<h3>VASP<a class="headerlink" href="#vasp" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Note: you can skip this step if you do not plan to run VASP with atomate.</p>
<p>To get access to VASP on supercomputing resources typically requires that you are added to a user group on the system you work on after your license is verified. You will also need access to the pseudopotentials. For convenience, you might copy these to the same directory you will be installating atomate, but this is not required. Regardless of its location, the directory structure should look like:</p>

<div class="section" id="mongodb">
<h3>MongoDB<a class="headerlink" href="#mongodb" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/">MongoDB</a> is a NoSQL database that stores each database entry as a document, which is represented in the JSON format (the formatting is similar to a dictionary in Python). Atomate uses MongoDB to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>store the workflows that you want to run as well as their state details (through FireWorks - required)</li>
<li>to parse output files and create database of calculation results (strongly recommended and assumed by most default settings of workflows, but technically optional)</li>
</ul>
<p>MongoDB must be running and available to accept connections whenever you are running workflows. Thus, it is strongly recommended that you have a server to run MongoDB or (simpler) use a hosting service. Your options are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>use a commercial service to host your MongoDB instance. These are typically the easiest to use and offer high quality service but require payment for larger databases. <a class="reference external" href="https://mlab.com">mLab</a> offers free 500 MB databases with payment required for larger databases or support/backup. The free service is certainly enough to get started for small to medium size projects.</li>
<li>contact your supercomputing center to see if they offer MongoDB hosting (e.g., NERSC has this)</li>
<li>self-host a MongoDB server</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are just starting, we suggest the first (with a free plan) or second option (if available to you). The third option will require you to open up network settings to accept outside connections properly which can sometimes be tricky.</p>
<p>Next, create a new database and set up two new username/password combinations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>an admin user</li>
<li>a read-only user</li>
</ul>
<p>You might choose to have <em>two</em> separate databases - one for the workflows and another for the results. We suggest that new users keep both sets of results in a single database and only consider using two databases if they run into specific problems.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Hang on to your credentials - we will configure FireWorks to connect to them in a later step. Also make sure you know the hostname and port for the MongoDB instance.</div></blockquote>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<blockquote>
<div>The computers that perform the calculations must have access to your MongoDB server. Some computing resources have firewalls blocking connections. Note that this is not a problem for most computing centers that allow such connections (particularly from MOM-style nodes, e.g. at NERSC, SDSC, etc.), but some of the more security-sensitive centers (e.g., LLNL, PNNL) will run into issues. If you run into connection issues later in this tutorial, some options are:</div></blockquote>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>contact your computing center to review their security policy to allow connections from your MongoDB server (best resolution)</li>
<li>set up an ssh tunnel to forward connections from allowed machines (the tunnel must be kept alive at all times you are running workflows)</li>
<li>use <a class="reference external" href="https://materialsproject.github.io/fireworks/offline_tutorial.html">FireWorks offline mode</a>, which is a workable solution but makes the system more difficult to use and limits some features of FireWorks.</li>

<span id="id4"></span><h2>Create a directory scaffold for atomate<a class="headerlink" href="#create-a-directory-scaffold-for-atomate" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Installing atomate includes installation of codes, configuration files, and various binaries and libraries. Thus, it is useful to create a directory structure to hold all these items.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Log in to the compute cluster and make sure the Python module you want to use is loaded and added to your rc file (e.g. <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.bashrc</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.bashrc.ext</span></code> at NERSC)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Create a directory in a spot on disk that has relatively fast access from compute nodes <em>and</em> that is only accessible by yourself or your collaborators. Your Python codes and config files will go here, including database credentials. We will call this place <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;&lt;INSTALL_DIR&gt;&gt;</span></code>. A good name might simply be <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">atomate</span></code>, but you could also use a project-specific name (e.g., <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">atomate-solar</span></code>).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Now you should scaffold the rest of your <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;&lt;INSTALL_DIR&gt;&gt;</span></code> for the things we are going to do next. Create a directories named <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">codes</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">logs</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">config</span></code> so your directory structure looks like:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>atomate

<div class="section" id="create-a-python-virtual-environment">
<span id="id5"></span><h2>Create a Python virtual environment<a class="headerlink" href="#create-a-python-virtual-environment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We highly recommended that you organize your installation of the atomate and the other Python codes using a virtual environment (e.g. <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">virtualenv</span></code> or similar tool such as anaconda). Ultimately, whether you want to use a virtual environment is optional and you don’t have to use one if you know what you are doing. Virtual environments allow you to keep an installation of Python and all of the installed packages separate from the installation on the system. Some of the main benefits are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Different Python projects that have conflicting packages can coexist on the same machine.</li>
<li>Different versions of Python can exist on the same machine and be managed more easily (e.g. Python 2 and Python 3).</li>
<li>You have full rights and control over the environment. If it breaks, you can just delete the folder containing the environment and recreate it. On computing resources, this solves permissions issues with installing and modifying packages.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The easiest way to get a Python virtual environment is to use the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">virtualenv</span></code> tool. Most Python distributions come with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">virtualenv</span></code>, but some clusters (e.g., NERSC) have moved towards using <a class="reference external" href="https://www.continuum.io">Anaconda</a>, which is a popular distribution of Python designed for scientific computing. If the compute resource you want to access is using Anaconda, you will follow the same general steps, but create your environment with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">conda</span> <span class="pre">create</span></code>. See the <a class="reference external" href="https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html">documentation for the conda command line tool here</a> as well as a <a class="reference external" href="https://conda.io/docs/_downloads/conda-pip-virtualenv-translator.html">conversion between virtualenv and conda commands</a>. To set up your virtual environment:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Go to your install directory (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;&lt;INSTALL_DIR&gt;&gt;</span></code>) and create a virtual environment there. A good name might be <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">atomate_env</span></code>. The command to create the environment would be <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">virtualenv</span> <span class="pre">atomate_env</span></code>, which creates a folder <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">atomate_env</span></code> in the directory you are in.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">You can <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ls</span></code> this directory and see that you have the following structure:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>atomate
├──atomate_env/
   ├── bin
   ├── include
   ├── lib
   ├── lib64
   └── pip-selfcheck.json
├── codes
├── config
└── logs
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If you look in the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bin</span></code> directory, you will see several programs, such as activate, pip, and Python itself. <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lib</span></code> will be where all of your installed packages will be kept, etc. Again, if anything goes wrong in installing Python codes, you can just delete the virtual environment directory (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">atomate_env</span></code>) and start again.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Activate your environment by running <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">source</span> <span class="pre">&lt;&lt;INSTALL_DIR&gt;&gt;/atomate_env/activate</span></code>. This makes it so when you use the command <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span></code>, the version of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span></code> that you use will be the one in the  <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bin</span></code> directory rather than the system-wide Python. You can read the activation script if you are interested. It’s just does a little magic to adjust your path to point towards the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bin</span></code> and other directories you created.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="install-python-packages">
<span id="id6"></span><h2>Install Python packages<a class="headerlink" href="#install-python-packages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You have successfully set up an environment in which to install atomate! Next, we will download and install all of the atomate-related Python packages. The main tool for installing Python packages is pip and we will use this to install packages (unless you have an Anaconda distribution where again, you’d use <a class="reference external" href="https://conda.io/docs/using/pkgs.html">conda</a>). Technically, you could simply use pip to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pip</span> <span class="pre">install</span> <span class="pre">atomate</span></code> and pull in atomate and all of the requirements from <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">PyPI</a>. In that case, you would <em>not</em> need to follow the rest of this section’s instructions.</p>
<p>However, our recommendation (and the procedure below) is to install directly from GitHub so you can always have the most recent codebase and be able to more easily inspect and modify the code. We’ll also do this for the main dependencies of atomate because they often change and evolve together in the source, but not be released to PyPI. Note that this method of installation is required if you will be developing in atomate or any of the other software mentioned here.</p>

<ol class="arabic simple">

<p>To test atomate and the VASP functionality, make sure you have MongoDB running when executing the tests. You can do this by navigating to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;&lt;INSTALL_DIR&gt;&gt;/codes/atomate/</span></code> and running <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span> <span class="pre">setup.py</span> <span class="pre">test</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">nosetests</span></code>.</p>
<p>These unit tests are designed to run without installing VASP. Some of them start with a VASP workflow but apply the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">use_fake_vasp</span></code> method to replace calling the VASP executable with a “Faker” that verifies basic properties of the inputs and copies pre-stored output files to the current directory, thus simulating the execution of VASP. Anyway, this will help make sure your installation is in good shape.</p>
<p>Many tests have a DEBUG option that can sometimes help in finding problems. Sometimes you need to toggle DEBUG on/off a couple of times if you are doing this to make sure all the old data is actually cleared between debug runs.</p>
<p>Note that the unit tests in atomate/vasp/tests/test_vasp_workflows.py can be modified to actually run VASP by setting VASP_CMD to a String representing your VASP command. If you need to debug at a later point, this might be something to refer back to.</p>

<p>To make sure that everything is set up correctly and in place, we’ll finally run a simple test workflow. In general, two ways to create workflows is using atomate’s command line utility <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">atwf</span></code> or by creating workflows in Python. More discussion on constructing and running workflows can be found in the <a class="reference internal" href="running_workflows.html#running-workflows-tutorial"><span class="std std-ref">Running Workflows Tutorial</span></a> and details on writing custom workflows can be found in the <a class="reference internal" href="creating_workflows.html#creating-workflows"><span class="std std-ref">Creating Workflows</span></a>. For now, we will use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">atwf</span></code> to construct a workflow. Ideally you set up a Materials Project API key in the <a class="reference internal" href="#configure-pymatgen">Configure pymatgen</a> section, otherwise you will need to provide a POSCAR for the structure you want to run. If you have an API key configured, you can run the following to run a structure optimization on Si</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>atwf add -l vasp -s optimize_only.yaml -m mp-149
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Alternatively, if you did not set up your API key or want to use a custom POSCAR instead the following command will accomplish the same</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>atwf add -l vasp -s optimize_only.yaml POSCAR
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>These commands added workflows for running a single structure optimization FireWork to your LaunchPad. You can verify that by using FireWorks’ <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lpad</span></code> utility:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>lpad get_wflows
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>which should return:</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To launch this FireWork and place a reservation in the queue, go to the directory where you would like your calculations to run (e.g. your scratch or work directories) and run the command</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>qlaunch -r rapidfire
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you want to run directly rather than through a queue, use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rlaunch</span> <span class="pre">rapidfire</span></code> (go through the FireWorks documentation to understand the details).</p>
<p>If all went well, you can check that the FireWork is in the queue by using the commands for your queue system (e.g. <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">squeue</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">qstat</span></code>) or by checking that the state of the FireWork has changed from <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">READY</span></code> to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">RESERVED</span></code> with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lpad</span> <span class="pre">get_wflows</span></code>. Once this FireWorks is launched and is completed, you can use pymatgen-db to check that it was entered into your results database by running</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>mgdb query -c <span class="s">&lt;&lt;INSTALL_DI</span>R&gt;&gt;/config/db.json --props task_id formula_pretty output.energy_per_atom

</div>
<p>This time, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;&lt;INSTALL_DIR&gt;&gt;</span></code> can be relative. You should have seen the energy per atom you calculated for Si.</p>
